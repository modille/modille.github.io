# Mazda3 speaker fix

## :broken_heart: Problem

I noticed a rattling coming from the front speakers in my 2014 Mazda3 i Grand Touring, particularly at lower frequencies.

It wasn't loose change rattling and it didn't seem to be any plastic body pieces rattling.

## :man_shrugging: Workaround

At first, I just adjusted the Mazda equalizer to move the bass as low as possible.

I also adjusted my Spotify app to enable an equalizer and turned down the lower frequencies as low as possible.

## :microscope: Diagnosis

After searching online, I came across numerous posts that mentioned the same issue.

Someone discovered that it was due to a piece of the speaker assembly rusting out and coming apart.
There is a drip guard above the speaker, but apparently it does not guard enough!

There's even a Technical Service Bulletin for it:

## :wrench: Fix

### Materials needed

- 6 x Door Trim Panel Fasteners (Mazda Part GJ6A-68-AB1), to replace any that break _($3)_
- 1 x Gorilla Epoxy _($7)_
- 1 x Piece of sandpaper, to roughen up the surfaces to be glued
- 1 x Beer to congratulate yourself afterwards

The total cost was about $10.

> **Note:** I actually found Nissan trim panel fasteners at a local auto parts store that were 99% identical to the ones I removed from the Mazda.

### Process

1. I removed and disconnected both front door panels. One fastener clip _(Door Trim Panel Fastener - Mazda Part GJ6A-68-AB1)_ broke as I removed the panels, and about 4 more were broken as I removed them from the door frame.
1. I disconnected the speakers and removed them.
1. I used some sandpaper to roughen up the surfaces that were to be glued together.
1. I glued the surfaces together with Gorilla Epoxy and let it dry overnight.
1. I put a 2nd coating of glue around the edge in the morning, and let it dry for an hour or so.
1. I put the speakers back in.
1. I re-connected the speakers.
1. I replaced all fastener clips in the door panels.
1. I re-connected and re-attached the front door panels.
1. I adjusted the equalizer in the Mazda and on my phone to return to normal levels.

Surprisingly enough, the door handles/buttons/windows were still functional and the speakers sounded perfect!
